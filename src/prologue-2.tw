:: prologue-2 {"position":"800,400","size":"100,100"}
ohoho we so dramatic lol


Added an optional box for these options. I like in-line stuff for when there are no choices, and then adding styling for when there are choices.

<div class="choices">
	[[Next|prologue-3]]
    [[Another next button|prologue-3]]
    [[And another!|prologue-3]]
</div>
